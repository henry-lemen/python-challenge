# python-challenge

This repository contains my submissions for the python challenge.

The first submission contained multiple errors in the code related to file handling and calculations. The second submission resolved some of these errors, but still left bugs and incorrect output. The third and most recent submission resolves these errors and achieves the correct outputs.
